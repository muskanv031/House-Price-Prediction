🏡 House Price Prediction Model

A machine learning project that predicts house prices based on various features such as area, number of bedrooms, location, and more. This repository includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and prediction scripts.

🚀 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to predict real-estate prices.
It covers the complete pipeline:

Data Collection & Cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Engineering

Model Building (Linear Regression / Random Forest / etc.)

Model Evaluation

Prediction on New Data

The goal is to build an accurate and reliable regression model for price prediction.
